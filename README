# BPC

*makechains.m produces PMEs for samples
*evalBPC.m calculates and displays BPC values for existing PMEs
*PMEplot.m displays a PME
*BPC2frac.m converts a BPC value (input by the user) into a combination of f1 and f2 values (see paper text)
*chain_const_joint.m, chain_const.m, mcmcautocorr_bpdf.m, mcmcmetro_bpdf.m, mcmcsampsiz_bpdf.m, mvncovcheck.m, nearestSPD.m, pchain_gen.m, sp_log_area.m, sp_log_prob_dens.m, and x_eval.m are called by makechains.m and are not intended for independent use.
*all files have detailed information about parameters and output
*running makechains.m can take some time. Because it generates PMEs for all possible intersample comparisons in the dataset, it generates N + (N-1) + (N-2) + ... + 1 PMEs, where N is the number of samples in the directory that is input into makechains.m. Generating each PME can take from 2-5 minutes (for sample sizes of 60-100) to 2 hours (samples sizes of ~4000) on a single core of a 2.2GHz processor with 16GB of memory. The scripts use MATLAB's parallelization.
